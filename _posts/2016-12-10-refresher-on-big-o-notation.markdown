title: Refresher on Big O notation
layout: post
---
##Description:
Big O notation is a quick way to roughly estimate the time complexity of a programs running time given an input size. 

##O(1): Constant time complexity.
No matter the size the time it takes for the operation is the same. 

##O(n^2): quadratic time complexity.
The time is quadratically related to the input size. Ex: n^2, n^3.

##O(n): linear time complexity.
The time is linearly related to input size.

##Points to remember:
- It focuses on the part of the code that is going to be executed multiple times.
- Constants are dropped to make.
- The code is analyzed for worst case scenario.
